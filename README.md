## 📝 How It Works

The tool uses the **Gamepad API** built into modern browsers to detect controllers. It polls inputs, reads numeric values from buttons and axes, and renders them live on the webpage for easy diagnosis.

1. Connect your gamepad via **USB** or **Bluetooth**.
2. Press any button to initialize detection.
3. View real-time input, joystick movement, and trigger response on screen.
